# Teams

Understand team organization and how to switch teams.

## Team Structure

Questions and pulse data are organized by team:
- Engineering
- Product
- Marketing
- General
- (etc.)

**Each team has:**
- Team-specific questions
- Team-specific pulse data
- Team-specific moderators
- Team-specific permissions

## Switch Teams

Click team name in navigation and select different team.

**What changes:**
- Questions shown (team-filtered)
- Submit question defaults to that team
- Pulse dashboard shows team data

## Your Primary Team

Your primary team is your default:
- Set by admin during onboarding
- Determines initial view on login
- Used for pulse cohort assignment
- Shown in your profile

**Change primary team:**
1. Click profile icon
2. Select "Profile"
3. Choose "Primary Team"
4. Save

## Team Memberships

You can be member of multiple teams:
- View questions in all your teams
- Submit questions to any team
- Different roles per team possible

**Example:**
- Engineering: Member
- Product: Viewer
- General: Member

## All Teams View

Admins and owners can view "All Teams":
- Organization-wide question view
- Aggregated pulse data
- Useful for leadership

**Access:** Click "All Teams" in navigation (if available).

## Team Question Counts

Navigation shows question counts per team:
- Open questions (number in badge)
- Helps identify active teams
- Real-time updates

## Team URLs

Each team has a shareable URL:
- `/engineering/open` - Engineering open questions
- `/product/answered` - Product answered questions
- `/general/all` - General all questions

**Use for:**
- Bookmarks
- Sharing specific views
- Deep linking

## Team Creation

Only admins can create teams.

**Request new team:**
1. Submit question to "General"
2. Tag with "Feature Request"
3. Admin will review

## Team Permissions

Permissions are team-scoped:

**Moderators:**
- Can only moderate their assigned teams
- Cannot access other teams' moderation features

**Members:**
- Can view and participate in all teams
- Can submit questions to any team

**Admins/Owners:**
- Full access to all teams
- Can manage all teams' content

See [Admin Guide - Roles](../admin/roles-permissions.md).

## Tips

1. **Submit to right team** - Choose team most relevant to question
2. **Check multiple teams** - Answer might be in related team
3. **Set primary team** - Makes your default view most useful
4. **Use All Teams** - (if admin) for org-wide view
