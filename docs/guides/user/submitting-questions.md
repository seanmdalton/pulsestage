## Submit a Question

1. Click "Submit Question" button
2. Enter your question

## Anonymous vs. Named

**Anonymous** (default):
- Your name is hidden
- Encourages honest questions
- Cannot be traced to you

**Named**:
- Your name is shown
- Useful for follow-up questions
- Shows accountability

**Tip:** Most questions are submitted anonymously.

## Team Selection

Questions are team-specific:
- Select the relevant team (Engineering, Product, etc.)
- Question appears only in that team's view
- Team moderators will answer

**Default:** Your primary team is pre-selected.

## Question Guidelines

**Good questions:**
- Specific and clear
- Relevant to team
- Appropriate for public forum

**Examples:**
- "What are our plans for remote work policy?"
- "How will the new product launch affect our roadmap?"
- "Can we get an update on the hiring timeline?"

**Avoid:**
- Personal HR issues (use HR directly)
- Confidential information
- Attacks or inappropriate content

## After Submission

Your question:
- Appears in team's "Open" tab
- Can be upvoted by others
- Will be answered by moderators

**Timeline:** Questions typically answered within 24-48 hours.

## Edit or Delete

**Cannot edit** after submission (prevents confusion with upvotes).

**To change:**
1. Delete question (if allowed)
2. Submit new version

**Or:** Wait for moderator to answer and clarify in follow-up.

## Tips

1. **Search first** - Check if question already asked
2. **Be specific** - "When will X launch?" vs. "What's the status?"
3. **One topic** - Ask separate questions for separate topics
4. **Context helps** - Briefly explain why you're asking
5. **Team matters** - Submit to most relevant team
