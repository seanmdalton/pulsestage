## Team Scoping

!!! warning "Important: Team Boundaries"
    Moderators are scoped to specific teams. You can only:
    
    - See questions from teams you moderate
    - Answer questions in your teams
    - Access moderation stats for your teams
    
    To moderate multiple teams, you must be explicitly added as a moderator to each team.

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Admin Panel** (visible when viewing a team you moderate)
2. **Review the Moderation Queue** to see pending questions
3. **Tag questions** to help organize them
4. **Answer questions** during your Q&A session
5. **Use Presentation Mode** for live events

## Quick Tips

!!! tip "Best Practices"
    - **Review regularly**: Check the moderation queue before sessions
    - **Use tags consistently**: Create a tagging taxonomy with your team
    - **Pin sparingly**: Only pin the most critical questions
    - **Freeze when needed**: Prevent vote manipulation on sensitive topics
    - **Answer thoroughly**: Clear, complete answers reduce follow-up questions

!!! info "Real-Time Collaboration"
    Multiple moderators can work simultaneously. Changes appear in real-time for all moderators and users.

## Moderation Workflow

A typical moderation workflow:

1. **Before the event**:
   - Review questions in the moderation queue
   - Tag questions by topic
   - Pin high-priority questions

2. **During the event**:
   - Launch presentation mode
   - Navigate through questions
   - Answer questions live
   - Freeze questions as they're addressed

3. **After the event**:
   - Review remaining unanswered questions
   - Check moderation stats
   - Follow up on any outstanding items
