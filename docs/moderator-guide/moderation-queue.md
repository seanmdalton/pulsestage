- Prioritize for upcoming town hall

- Tracks who froze and when

## Best Practices

### Efficient Workflow

1. **Filter to "Needs Review"** - See only unreviewed questions
2. **Sort by team** - Focus on your assigned teams
3. **Use bulk tags** - Tag similar questions at once (e.g., all "Policy" questions)
4. **Pin urgent items** - Ensure leadership sees critical questions
5. **Freeze resolved** - Lock questions that don't need more upvotes

### Tag Strategy

Common tag patterns:

- **"Important"** - High-priority questions
- **"Reviewed"** - Questions already addressed in presentation mode
- **"Currently Presenting"** - Active question in presentation (auto-managed)
- **"Follow-up"** - Needs additional action
- **"Policy"**, **"Benefits"**, **"Culture"** - Topic categories

### Bulk Operations Tips

- **Always review selection** before bulk delete
- **Use bulk tag** to categorize similar questions quickly
- **Bulk pin** for pre-town hall question prioritization
- **Bulk freeze** after event to archive historical questions
