## Activity Breakdown

Side panel showing additional metrics:

### Activity Metrics
- **Total Reviewed** - Same as overall card
- **Answer Rate** - Percentage of reviewed questions that were answered
- **Questions Frozen** - Total frozen in this period

### Team Activity
- **Active Moderators** - Number of moderators with activity
- **Avg per Moderator** - Questions reviewed per moderator
- **Coverage** - Total team assignments across all moderators

## Use Cases

### Monitor Moderator Performance

1. **Check default view** (last 30 days, all teams)
2. **Review per-moderator stats** - Who's most active?
3. **Check answer rates** - Are moderators responding?
4. **Review response times** - Are we answering quickly?

### Analyze Team Engagement

1. **Filter to specific team** (e.g., "Engineering")
2. **Check question volume** - How many questions from this team?
3. **Review moderator coverage** - How many moderators active?
4. **Check response quality** - Are questions getting answered?

### Historical Analysis

1. **Set custom date range** (e.g., Q1 2025)
2. **Compare periods** - More/less activity than last quarter?
3. **Identify trends** - Which teams need more moderation support?

### Performance Reviews

1. **Filter to specific moderator** using team filter
2. **Check their metrics** - Questions reviewed, answered, response time
3. **Compare to team average**
4. **Identify top performers** - Sorted by activity

## What Gets Tracked

### When is `reviewedBy` Set?

The `reviewedBy` field is automatically set when:

1. **Moderator answers a question** - `reviewedBy` = user who answered
2. **`reviewedAt` timestamp** - When the answer was submitted

### Moderation Actions Tracked

All moderation actions are counted:

- âœ… Answering questions
- âœ… Pinning/unpinning
- âœ… Freezing/unfreezing
- âœ… Tagging questions
- âœ… Bulk operations

## Interpreting Metrics

### High Review Count, Low Answer Count

**Indicates:** Moderators are active but not answering

**Possible reasons:**
- Questions are being triaged/tagged but not answered
- Questions frozen or archived without answers
- Bulk operations counting as reviews

### Long Response Times

**Indicates:** Delay between question submission and answer

**Possible reasons:**
- Questions submitted far in advance of town hall
- Complex questions requiring research
- Low moderator availability

**Action:** Consider more moderators or faster triage process

### Uneven Distribution

**Indicates:** Some moderators much more active than others

**Possible reasons:**
- Different team sizes
- Uneven team assignments
- Some moderators more engaged

**Action:** Review team assignments and workload distribution

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

- **Check weekly** - Review last 7 days of activity
- **Monthly reports** - Compare month-over-month trends
- **Pre-event** - Ensure all moderators prepared for town halls

### Setting Expectations

Use stats to set team goals:

- **Target response time** - e.g., < 24 hours
- **Answer rate** - e.g., > 80% of reviewed questions answered
- **Coverage** - Each team has >= 2 active moderators

### Recognizing Top Performers

- **Sort by questions reviewed** - See most active moderators
- **Share achievements** - Recognize top contributors
- **Balance workload** - Redistribute if one moderator doing too much
